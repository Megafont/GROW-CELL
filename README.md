# GROW-CELL
This is an open-source project being worked on by me and a team at P1 Games.

In the game CELL, the player is put in the role of the immune system and must defend against bacteria, fungi, and viruses.
We currently have a fully playable version of the game on [[itch.io]](https://wolfy411.itch.io/cell?secret=wd6cm82k6FiyGrGRf1KFTrRUKmg), but it is still very much in active development.
