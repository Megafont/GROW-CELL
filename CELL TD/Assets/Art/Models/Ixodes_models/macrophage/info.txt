Also I use emmissive map like a displase map and add small random power to it, to make it breathing. It posible make by shading without any bones
_baseColor - base diffuse color 
_normal  - normal map 
_emissive  - emmisive map, some time reqare multiply for better looks, depends on scine light
_occlusionRoughnessMetallic  - rbg file content multiple texture, R chanel - ambient oclusion, G chanel -Roughnes map, B chanel - metallic map
